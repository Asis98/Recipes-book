# Recipes-book
I wanted the application to be a book of recipes, allowing users and home cooks to browse and share delicious food recipes.The main aim of the app is to
provide inspiration for meals as well as help users do the following:
• Share their recipes
• Save the favorite ones to easily find them
• Distinguish the top-rated recipes
• Filter out recipes according to some criteria

# Application startup 
You need to start the server by running the following command in the recipes-bookapi folder: npm run server:start
The server will be running at http://localhost:3001.
Then, you start the frontend by running the following command in the recipes-bookfront folder: ng serve --proxy-config proxy.config.json
